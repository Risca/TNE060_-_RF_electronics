\subsection{Discussion}

The inductor and capacitor values above are very exact and in reality a compromise is more likely. Capacitors and inductors usually have discrete values of the E12 series, although distributed networks may be designed to closely match the desired values.

The real world matching might not be as perfect as in simulation because of fluctuations in parameter values for both the transistor and the components used for the matching networks (lumped or distributed). In a lumped design, the effect of transmission lines acting as components has to be taken into considerations as well.
