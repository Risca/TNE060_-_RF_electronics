\subsection{Discussion}

The inductor and capacitor values above are very exact and in reality a compromise is more likely. Lumped capacitors and inductors usually have discrete values, eg. from the E12 series. Distributed networks, however, may be designed to closely match the desired values, depending on the microfabrication process and equipment.

The real world matching might not be as perfect as in simulation because of fluctuations in parameter values for both the transistor and the components used for the matching networks (lumped or distributed). In a lumped design, the effect of transmission lines acting as components as well as parasitics from the body of the component has to be taken into considerations as well.
