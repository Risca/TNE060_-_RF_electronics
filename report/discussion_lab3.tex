\subsection{Discussion}

A band-pass filter consisting of only lumped components are what seems to be the most ideal, but lumped components themselves are not ideal and most probably would the circuit in fig.~\ref{fig:Filter A circuit} exhibit a very non-ideal filter response.

From the simulation results in fig.~\ref{fig:S-parameters lab3}, the pass-band area seem to be up-shifted in frequency by X\% for a 2\nd order distributed filter based on a RO4350B substrate and by Y\% for a 2\nd and 3\rd order distributed filter based on a FR-4 substrate. WHY THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE NO IDEA!!!
