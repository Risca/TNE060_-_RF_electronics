\subsection{Discussion}

A band-pass filter consisting of only lumped components are what seems to be the most ideal, but lumped components themselves are not ideal and most probably would the circuit in fig.~\ref{fig:Filter A circuit} exhibit a very non-ideal filter response.

From the simulation results in fig.~\ref{fig:S-parameters lab3}, the pass-band area seem to be up-shifted in frequency by $\sim 1\%$ for a 2\nd order distributed filter based on a RO4350B substrate and by almost 14\% for a 2\nd and 3\rd order distributed filter based on a FR-4 substrate.

By comparing the two substrates dielectric constant to each other, using the equations from chapter~\ref{subsubsec: Microstrip_Parameters}, it is found that $\lambda_{FR-4}$ is $\sim 11\%$ larger than $\lambda_{RO4350B}$. This could very well be the cause of this frequency shift.
