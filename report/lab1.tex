\section{Simulations with Advanced Design System}
Many properties of RF circuits can be quite time consuming and a bit cumbersome to analyze by hand. ADS is a powerful tool that is very useful for a radio frequency engineer with the ability to aid in this topic. But it is not only useful with complex circuits and can very well be used to control a single component's parameters.
Just the meaning of the last sentence was conducted to get well acquainted with ADS. The main parts focused on in this report are how to use ADS to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Calculate the width of a microstrip with a given length and with desired characteristics.
	\item How the get the step response of a given circuit.
	\item How to analyze the behavior of a circuit when a pulse is transmitted towards it.
\end{itemize}
