\subsection{Theoretical background}
To get a picture of how well the simulations of a microstrip in ADS are were the parameters of a microstrip analyzed analytically to compare with. This was done by solving three basic problems.

\subsubsection{Microstrip Parameters}\label{subsubsec: Microstrip_Parameters}
The mictrostrip that was analyzed was defined in problem 2.13 in [TODO: Ref to text book.] as
`It is desired to construct a 50 $\Omega$ microstrip line. The relative dielectric constant is 2.23 and the board height is h = 787 $\mu \text{m.}$ Find the width, wavelength and effective dielectric constant when the thickness of the copper trace is negligible. Assume an operating frequency of 1 GHz.'

By using that $Z_{f} = \sqrt{\mu_{0} \epsilon_{0}} = 376.8 \Omega$ together with the formula for the effective dielectric constant;
\begin{equation}
	\epsilon_{eff} = \dfrac{\epsilon_{r} + 1}{2} + \dfrac{\epsilon_{r} - 1}{2} \left(1 + {\dfrac{12 h}{w}} \right)^{-1/2} \text ,
\end{equation}
the formula for characteristic impedance
\begin{equation}
	Z_0 = \dfrac{Z_f}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{eff}}\left(1.393 + \dfrac{w}{h} + \dfrac{2}{3} \text{ln}\left(\dfrac{w}{h} + 1.444 \right)\right)}
\end{equation}
where the width-height ratio is computed with
\begin{equation}
	\dfrac{w}{h} = \dfrac{2}{\pi}\left(B - 1 - \text{ln}\left(2B - 1 \right) + \dfrac{\epsilon_r - 1}{2 \epsilon_r}\left(\text{ln}\left(B -1\right) + 0.39 - \dfrac{0.61}{\epsilon_r}\right)\right)
\end{equation}
and where B is given by
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{Z_f \pi}{2Z_0\sqrt{\epsilon_r}}
\end{equation}
and the formula for wavelength
\begin{equation}
	\lambda = \dfrac{c}{f\sqrt{\epsilon_{eff}}}.
\end{equation}
This gives $w = 2.91 \text{mm}$, $\lambda = 229.51 \text{mm}$ and $\epsilon_{eff} = 1.71 \text{.}$
\subsubsection{Transmissionline Phaseshift}
When designing a microstrip that has a length that differs from the wavelength will a missmatch occur. So, what phaseshift will occur if the microstrip given in \ref{subsubsec: Microstrip_Parameters} has a length of 15 cm?

Since the wavelength is longer that the microstrip length will the phaseshift be less than one period and therefore can the pasheshift be calculated as
\begin{equation}
	\text{ps} = \dfrac{l}{\lambda} 360 \:^\circ
\end{equation}
and this gives ps = 235.3 $^\circ$.
